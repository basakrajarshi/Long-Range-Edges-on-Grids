# Long-Range-Edges-on-Grids
A grid lattice contains nodes in which each node except for those on the boundary, connects to its neighbors above, below, left and right of itself.  We use an SI model, and explore how the average epidemic size and average epidemic length vary as a function of the (infection) transmission probability. Then, with the possibility of adding a long range edge with a probability q, we explore epidemic dynamics on the same network.
